# Airport Challenge

##Â Introduction

Airport challenge is a simple model of an airport. It is a challenge I have completed in serveral other langauges. I use it when first getting to grips with a language to better understand how to build and use classes in that language. I also use it to practice dependancy injection and doubling when testing.
